### Sprite/Image Editor

A simple GUI that will have a grid style drawing tool with limited color
palette.
Saves the image in a json matrix object.

### Level Editor

Uses the json images as tiles to create the background, then adds *solid*
images on top as impassable terrain. Also saves in a json matrix object.
